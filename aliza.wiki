Aliza, my familiar

This is a very interesting project with a couple of parts.

First I will be writing a software version of Aliza which will assist me in the
tuplamancy portion, and it will be extremely useful in my daily life anyway.

Then I will eventually have Aliza as my familiar in all situation, because she
will be a fully formed tulpa. This is going to be an awesome project of practical
occultism.

Anyway, what I want to accomplish is pretty simple in some regards, very difficulkt
in other regards.

I really need to have a parts of speech analuzer so that I can determine what the subject of a sentence is.

And I need a sentiment analyzer so that I can detect whether the person's emotional state.

With those two pieces of information it should be possible to write a good therapist bot hat just keeps
asking questions in order to keep a conversation going, but does't really have to answer questions.

That should be doable. I think. The trickier part will be getting her to learn or anything resembling
actual intelligence. But I suppose that won't really be a problem once I get to tulpaforcing.
