= Invisible Man =

An attempt to make a taoist superhero / fiction suit for myself.

Matthias works in a secret government lab. His genius older colleague has just created a prototype nano-material suit with incredible power. But when he realizes what the government plans to do with it, he rebels and is liquidated by the government.

Dr. Ishio Nizuma

Matthias discovers this and steals the prototype suit. He also destroys all the government's records 

After realizing that his colleague is dead and has no living relatives, Matthias drains Dr. Ishio Nizuma's accounts to fund his new campaign against the puppet government.

The suit is able to modulate all frequencies of electro-magnetic radiation. This can make it invisible to all forms of non sonic detection. It allows Matthias to only wear the suit and _appear_ to be wearing normal clothing, and thus instantly go invisible without having to worry about removing clothing.

The invisible man uses daoist and non violent means to effect change. For example, he might appear to a politician and speak to him in what the politician thinks is a hallucination.

= The Hollow Life of Steven Smith =

Steven Smith worked to earn money. He spent his money gratifying his carnal pleasures. When he was with his friends he competed over their material status. His life was hollow.

= The Great Red Rite =

An Eternal King is reborn every time he dies, by mating with his queen. While he is a child, the queen reigns, and it is her duty to raise her son to be the eternal king.

Is the king the same soul? Or is his personality just reassembled each time by the collection of memories and books that are kept in the keep?
