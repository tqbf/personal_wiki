== hearing ==

Improve hearing by only listening to music on the lowest volume setting.

== vision ==

Improve vision by always exercising the eyes. Try to blur text and view objects
in the distance. Additionally, do eye exercises.

== memory ==

There are many ways to improve memory, most of which are still unfamiliar to me.
I should start to work on that.

== sense of direction ==

Carry a compass, but don't look at it. Try to maintain an internal state of
knowing which direction is north. Periodically stop, point to where you think
is north, and compare what the compass says. Record how many degrees you were
off by.

== sense of time ==

Carry a watch, but don't look at it. Try to maintain an internal state of knowing
what time it is. Periodically stop, guess what time it is, and look at the watch.
Record how many minutes you were off by.
