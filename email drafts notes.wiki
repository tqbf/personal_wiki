hackNY's last speaker event featured the partners of Union Square Ventures: Albert Wenger, Andy Weissman, Brad Burnham, Fred Wilson, and John Buttrick. 


Infrastructure layer of internet just finished, so they looked to invest in the applications. (2004)
They want services that CHANGE the market instead of only making incremental improvements.
Native services that are doing something that can ONLY be accomplished because of the new platform, not simply moving something to the new platform.
Investment thesis: disruptive services using networks
Invested in Twitter before people were convinced by it.
Services with networks are more defensible.
Double-edged nature of network effects. Can cause the network to break down even faster.
Marketplaces like Etsy are especially cool.
Networks of course are no guarantee as MySpace demonstrates.
The new networked and decentralized services are more efficient, but are being fought with legislation by the existing players.
Unbundling. (Lending Club, Funding Circle, AirBnB, Uber)
The dynamic between unbundling and aggregation.
Attempting to apply the network benefits to their own investment portfolio.
Laisez faire approach to investment, not a control firm.
Potential conflicts of interest, and companies pivoting into each other.

Mobile services have huge disruptive potential.

Education and Finance are two major sectors that could use disruption.

Admiration for open source business models, ala 10gen.
It's not necessary to make money from every user in the system.

Invest in teams with a vision.

My own thoughts: great way to destroy the too big to fail banks, just replace
them with the network alternatives. Decentralized networked government to play
a role in the future. A "government" is just a social contract, we are parts of
tons of "governments", and we can begin to embrace the concept on a different
level.

I'm excited by Dwolla's potential to change the way we use money.

Google unbundled the portal, whereas yahoo was stuck in the past.

Silicon Valley is going to beccome less important as San Francisco becomes more
valuable. An advantage of New York is diversity: there are more different inputs
for startups here.

Saying goodbye doesn't get easier.

= norwegian essay =
Jeg var hjemme i ferien. Ofte drar jeg til Chicago i ferien, men ikke denne gangen. I år min venn i Chicago var opptatt, så jeg slappet av hjemme. Jeg gjorde mange slags aktiviteter for å slappe av. Jeg jogget gjennom nablolaget mitt. Jeg gikk ned Johnson Street, og besøkte butikkene der.

I vinterferien var romkameratene mine borte. Derfor var det stille i huset. Det var perfekt for mange aktiviteter som krever konsentrasjon. Jeg mediterte mange timer hver dag. Å meditere så mye ble dypt avslappende. Jeg lyttet til mange forskjellige slags musikk, inkludert norsk musikk. Jeg likte Röyksopp, Annie, og Erlend Øye. Jeg gikk også til live konserter. For eksempel, så jeg Wookiefoot på nyttårsaften.

Fordi det var stille leste jeg mange bøker. Jeg leste om matematikk og fysikk primært. Jeg har også lyttet til radio på nrk.no. Jeg så på Republican primære debatter. De var interessant, men også merkelig.

Jeg dro til mine foreldres hus. Jeg spilte piano med mora mi. Min mor spilte musikk av Debussy. Min søster har kokt mange nye mat som jeg spiste. Hennes mat er svært smakfull. Jeg spilte sjakk med mine brødre. Jeg vinner fleste spill, men de blir mye bedre i sjakk. Jeg traff gamle venner og snakket med dem.

Jeg gjorde husarbeid også, selvfølgelig. Romkameratene mine forlot huset et rot. Jeg tok ut søpla. Jeg vasket retter. Jeg støvsuget gulvene. Fordi huset var så rotete ryddet jeg i flere dager. Men det var ikke så ille som det virker. Jeg kunne meditere under rengjøringen. Så rengjøring ble faktisk veldig avslappende også.

Jeg ønsker at ferien var lenger. Det var fortsatt mye jeg ønsket å gjøre.

= notes from medtronic 2 =
/*
 * Well, so far I've been sort of upset with the state of the code currently. At least they found my computer, so that's nice. That way when I go home I can go and play some nice relaxing dungeon crawl.
 * Man, the level of incompetence in the previous programmers is simply astounding. It's like they have no concept of the ideas of code reuse, and are simply idiots who didn't bother reading about
 * what is possible, and instead just jumped straight in without any preparation. Now, the most difficult task for me is going to be figuring out how I can work on the new interface without blowing everything
 * up. It is going to be tricky I imagine. Okay... this is starting to get annoying. This is a really big project, so I'm going to have to break it down into
 * parts so that I can figure out what I need to do. This is the kind of task where I could get overwhelmed and not make any progress if I don't think about
 * what it is that I have to do. I think that a pretty major problem is that I don't know the entire architecture of the existing program yet. There seem to
 * be several layers of stateful interactions all going on at the same time, which is exactly the reason why imperative programming is a pain in the behind. It
 * is difficult to isolate things, and in order to get the program running I think I have to have everything working? Maybe, maybe not. If it is at least 
 * compartmentalized so that I can work on one form at a time I think I have a way forward. I'm not holding my breath though. I mean, my brain hurts a little
 * just thinking about this... jk. I really just need to have all my tools at my disposal, like my pad, so that I can plan my thoughts out. I think I can handle
 * this in little parts pretty easily. And then I could really make a critical contribution to this project, because, let's be honest, the current interface is
 * a load of junk that I would not want to use as a doctor. Not to mention how weirdly shoddy the programming is, I mean, come on, who is doing this stuff? I 
 * really hope that Paul wasn't the person who wrote a lot of the code. That had better have been this "Braun" company that we bought out. But Christ, Medtronic
 * bought them out for how much money? And the product that they had wasn't even complete, it was incomplete and somewhat garbage? I mean, that's a bit strange.
 * But I'm not a medtronic executive so I don't get a say in these things. But I do get to raise quality concerns, because that's something you are supposed to
 * at medtronic. I wonder what the fastest I can type is, like could my typing keeep up with my thoughts? Could it even come close? Probably not, right? I don't
 * know. I am guessing probbably not becausae my typing really isn't that fast right now. But it really could become faster if I were to deliberately practice at typing faster. Yes, I mean, it is possible for me to make significant gains at my typing speed.
 *
 * Hm, I'm thinking about a programming language again. I really liked that idea of just having a database of functions. I think his approach was sort of silly
 * though, the way you can create unique names for all the methods is just to use hash of some essential properties it has.
 * 
 * Anyway, I was thinking, why not have methods get back a Parameters object that includes a good amount of information and that way things would be a lot cooler.
 *
 * You can either use the informal parameters that are more like a normal language, or you can just accept a Parameters object.
 *
 * func add = Parameter p ->
 *   sum = 0
 *   1:to p:size;each i ->
 *     sum += p:get i
 *   sum
 *
 * I'm this close to passing out due to boredom. I mean seriously, I am tired and hungry and I can't do much right now.
 * Could I actually start writing a story here? Seems a little unlikely, but we could try. Let's see... I still need to flesh this out a bit right now, but
 * basically the main character is someone who was put into cyrofreezing right before the zombie apocalypse, so he is unfamiliar with the new world around him.
 * That gives us the excuse we need to have a character that asks a lot of questions. Well, got a lot to think about, so hopefully I can power through all of it.
 * I wonder how Kevin's test went. If it went well that would be swell. 
 *
 * Man, this is a pretty clever plot device actually, because it allows all sorts of possibilities that were previously constraining. So, for one thing, we can
 * set this as many years into the future as we want, because whatever we do the main character can still be young and still remember how things were in the old
 * days. That will allow him better insight into the way things are currently, because he knows how technology from his time has been twisted using the terms
 * of fantasy settings.
 *
 * So, who is this illusive main character? And I'm all alone now, so that's fun. Aha, now I can all keeping to myself in here. Time to get productive.
 *
 * Who is the main character? Should I start writing stories with stoic main characters? I think that could fit into this story, but not the other ones. 
 * So this guy is a stoic, what else is he? I think he is very scientific minded, so he has an advantage in this world due to his superior understanding of how
 * everything works. As a drawback though, all the mysticism is something he wants no part in, so he is unwilling to bill himself as a great magician. His
 * goal is to educate people about how things really should be. Maybe that isn't his actual GOAL, per se, but it definitely is an instinct that drives his 
 * actions. 
 *
 * We'll keep developing that character over time. I don't want to sit here thinking about him for too long though, because he certainly isn't the only
 * character that will be in this story. Other characters are just as important. If I end up here much longer I'm going to have to change my time sheet to
 * say 5.5 hours or maybe even 6 hours. This is sort of annoying, I hope that Kevin gets here soon. I should have established a definite time that we are 
 * leaving. Well, I think that should be 6:00. Oh, is Kevin doing that research study today? That could very well explain why he isn't here right now. Also,
 * having the screen so that only a few lines of the comments are displayed and a sizable amount of the code is displayed is another good idea for making
 * everything look like I'm just programming. It's all about the little things, baby. But seriously, I need to do a lot of actual programming while I'm here, 
 * because if I don't that's going to look really bad. I have to at least exit this place with a glowing recommendation, even if I don't want to stay here and
 * work for the rest of my life. I know I definitely don't want to do that now, even if Medtronic's mission is noble and everything, they are still a large
 * corporation like any other, and being here will still end up stiffling my creativity. The only true way to be free is to be self reliant, you know.
 *
 * Should we do good because it makes us happy? 
 *
 * No. There are countless situations where you must do good and it won't feel good. Only the strongest of people are able to do this. Imagine giving a homeless
 * man $5 and having him say "fuck you" in response. This would cause a lot of people to regret giving the homeless man the money, and would probably prevent
 * them from giving the homeless man any money in the future. That's allowing ourselves to be affected. A true stoic must do good even when he knows there will
 * be no chance he will enjoy or benefit from it. If no good deed goes unpunished, then the true stoic awaits his punishment every time. 
 *
 * Neo-Stoicism
 * Becoming an überman.
 *
*  Some principles:
*  Nothing has meaning except that which you give it. The only things with intrinsic meaning are your thoughts.
*  Your actions are meaningful to the extent that you freely choose them: your thought and your choice give your actions meaning.
*  Actions you carry out under threat lack the fullness of normal meaning, because the coercion changes the action from something that reflects who you are
*  to something that reflects what the situation is.
*
*  The Christian promise of Heaven or threat of Hell is a common way that people make their actions less meaningful. What seems better? Seeing someone you
*  normally wouldn't help, and deciding freely that you do want to help them. OR, deciding that you do want to help them, because if you don't there will be a
*  negative consequence as a result.
*
*  Think about this: a murderer (someone who chose to commit murder) isn't a good person if he acts in good ways while having a gun pointed to his head. And 
*  most people agree that someone who acts wrongly under great duress from an evil captor doesn't become an evil person. The INTENT behind an action is vital.
*  A good person does good for its own sake. A vain person does good for attention. A greedy person does good for the benefits that might result from a 
*  reputation as a good person. Etc. 
*
*  To become a truly good person you must do good because you feel that doing good is the right choice. There's no reason for why you should be good, trying to
*  justify good behavior by invoking anything else implies that we value whatever our justification is more than money. If we justified goodness with material
*  benefits, then we are saying that material benefit is more important than goodness. If goodness didn't happen to also benefit you materially, you wouldn't be
*  good. That's just sad.
*
*  Why should you act in a good manner? Just because. Goodness is unjustifiable.
*
*  !!!! GOODNESS IS UNJUSTIFIABLE
*
*  Free from Illusion: pick up an object and examine it closely. What comes to mind when you think of the object? Do some qualities, like 'valuable' or 'sentimental' come up? There is no such thing as a valuable object, only objects we choose to value. Gold has no value to the universe. It's just another metal.
*  Humans choose to give gold value. Become unmaterialistic by realizing that the only value that exists is that which you create. Then you can be free from
*  the shackles of money.
*
*  Unafraid of Death: Death is the cessation of sensation. Remember now, that our struggle as stoics is to free ourselves from interpreting 
*
 * An Überman is:
 * 1. Free : there is no imperative that a stoic live honorably; instead, it is the fact that he freely chooses sacrifice that gives his actions meaning.

= notes from medtronic 1 = 
/*!!!
 * Left my bag at the moundsview location, so I need to make sure and call lost and found for it.
 * Dang yo, this computer is working really slowly. I think that C# form designer thing is really resource heavy for a lot of junk.
 * I wonder what the procedure here is for upgrading computers. If I sprung for a new computer personally, would I be able to use it at work?
 * Will they allow me to use Linux at work? Obviously outlook wouldn't be working on that.
 *
 * I'm going to hide a little code in the notes directory so that I can easily switch to if someone is coming, that way I have some cover. It'll just look like
 * I was editing code in Vim I hope. I should add some documentation looking things so that's what it looks like. Actually, I could just make my notes template
 * the code with a nice big blank space for documentation that I will fill in. Good idea.
 *
 * Okay, so anyway... heh, lost my track of thought there, but this is pretty incongruous looking. I mean, you would have to both be looking closely to see my
 * little font. So I think this is a pretty fool proof plan. Of course, I can be a pretty exceptional fool, like if I were to spend an entire day at work and get
 * no work at all done. But the thing is, I'm not going to do that.
 *
 * So yeah, I installed git today, which actually took a decent amount of time, and setup a repository for the whole project. I'm doing this because I am going
 * to be making a LOT of changes to the code, and I don't want to get stuck in any situations where I don't know which version of a file is which. If I ever got
 * to one of those nasty points where a change I made broke the whole system I want complete assurance that I can get back to the point I was at before and not
 * be stuck at the bug. I've had some disasters with having to start a project over because it wasn't version controlled and I coded myself into a corner. So
 * I'm not going to let that happen.
 *
 * Valerie Mitchell is the name of the person I need to contact for the perceptorship opportunity. I think it would be valuable for me to go and meet individuals
 * using Medtronic's current touch screen or otherwise devices to see what they have to say. I suspect that they will have a lot of advice to offer, because 
 * these interfaces are far from perfect. Far far from perfect. But I'm going to work on that and hopefully make a big impact. I don't think I will be getting 
 * much done today, though, because I'm already pretty tired. And I have these three rocking story ideas that I can't wait to flesh out.
 *
 * Okay, so the first one is one that Shaun helped me think of last night--well, actually, I think it would be fair to say that every single one of these was inspired in part by our conversations, but anyway. So the idea is that fifty years after the zombie apocalypse (also, I don't like Vim uses :set spell and :set nospell. I think it should be like :set spell on and :set spell off, but anyway)--also, Andy is so going to dig this idea, along with everyone else, it really is a cool idea--the level of technology in society has ....
 *
 * Okay, so another interruption. One nice thing about this format is I can just go and type code into any method and it doesn't really matter, so it is even
 * easier to just be sneakily switching to looking like working from not working. This is defnitely a drawback to being intelligent, is that I know how to set
 * things like this up and let myself not work. But this isn't going to be something we just sit here and do for 8 hours obviously, I don't think I could even
 * sustain writing for eight hours. Maybe if I was really badly procrastinating on my actual work. But I shouldn't do that, because work is important. Dang. Vim
 * is supremely useful. I can just jump around all over the place here by using marks. This is really cool. Man, I am really thirsty, better make a trip to the
 * water cooler. Btw, I need to remember that I should write a report to Paul so that he knows what I've been doing today, because today is going to be a lot 
 * shorter of a day than usual from the perspective of actually getting work here done. I mean, seriously I have been at that training thing all morning and that
 * has been a serious drain on my time. Heh, hard at work or hardly working? Impossible to determine now. I could be doing one or the other and they would look
 * indistinguishable.
 *
 * ... Losing my computer for a bit is going to quite a damper on my ability to play Crawl. I wonder if Kevin can come by early to pick me up so I could go look for
 * my bag. But I doubt that is worth it. It'll probably show up in the found list pretty quick, judging by the items on there and the times posted. I mean, it
 * was updated just two days ago, so that isn't bad at all. ...
 *
 * Right, so back to the zombie story. Technology has really been set back after a fifty years due to the loss of network effects, knowledgable people being
 * killed off, inavailability of materials, etc. The ramifications of this are that technology has pretty much
 *
 * ... okay, the way that solarized now just has a menu is pretty killer. It has definitely made some progress...
 *
 * reverted to the medival ages. Of course, there is still a lot of random technology lying around. The premise of this story is illustrating Carl Sagan's saying that sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. 
 *
 * ... Man, as I'm typing my coworker is blatantly wasting time on his iPod, so I feel a bit better about doing this. Still makes me feel a bit bad about wasting company time, but everyone takes breaks and mine only take a few minutes inbetween huge bouts of actual programming, so maybe I shouldn't feel too bad. I don't know. ...
 *
 * ... the formatting of this thing is starting to get a bit inconsistent but it shouldn't matter too much, but whatever. ...
 *
 * So in this post-apocalyptic universe there are still certain individuals who retain their skills and abilities from the past when technology was abundant and
 * people knew how to operate it. For example, "Liches" are old medical devices professionals who are still able to maintain some of the medical devices they
 * used to work on. This gives them a longer life span (I might want to change the setting of the story from 50 years after, I'm not sure what would be the most
 * suitable period yet... still thinking about that), but they are bound to their "phylactery" which is just a big box of their various pacemakers and whatnot
 * hooked up to an improvised battery. But to most people, they are wizards who are able to extend their lifespan. Guns have become rarities (okay, so probably longer than 50 years for that to happen, considering that 10% of US residents are hunters, so that knowledge isn't going to go away real soon... but eventually
 * they are going to run out of ammo and spare parts) and people who wield them are more or less a special class of people.
 *
 * ... another tangent. I feel that when I'm just writing off the cuff my writing style is incredibly verbose. Lots of waste words, lots of unnecessary phrases and long winded ways of explaining concepts. But that's what editing is for I guess, I would much prefer to just be able to write in a terse style (which I want
 * to make my signature), but that's not going to happen until I cut out more verbal noise IN MY BRAIN...
 *
 * ... this is actually a scarily good look into the way my thought process is just easily distracted and bouncing about all the place on only semi related 
 * threads. I guess I probably could just sit and write for eight hours. I don't think I would run out of material if I just kept running off whatever is on
 * the top of my mind. I mean, during the day there are so many insights I have as it is that I think should be written down but I don't get around to. I have 
 * to make sure I'm not forgetting any good ideas for neo-stoicism so that I don't forget them...
 *
 * Okay, so before I forget my two other story ideas I should just type them out right now so I can recall them.
 * 1. Suburban full of chain mail and sword equipped vigilantes in a hostile suburban environment (this is obviously post-disaster). ... I do think it is kind
 * of sad that people assume everyone will just go bonkers and look out for only themselves the moment the world enters duress. I have great hopes that is a 
 * cataclysmic event were to strike the earth that humanity would band together and stand up to it. That's the hopeful message at the end of Watchmen... if you can call it that...
* 2. A serial killer who dresses up in a bizarre costume and murders people near holloween inspires a movie franchise. The greedy film executives seek to cash
* out as best they can, and next holloween release a feature film about the serial killer (who is generally thought of as an urban legend). The serial killer
* gleefully uses the opportunity presented by the numerous movie goers dressing up as him to murder and wreck havoc.
 *
 * ... Now, where was I? One intrinsic disadvantage of my brain is that my only slightly above average (according to the WISC IV) working memory and executive
 * function definitely have trouble keeping up with my hyperactive prefrontal lobe. Of course, working memory and executive function can be improved with
 * practice, so there is a road forward...
 *
 * Right, in this zombie infested world a huge number of the survivors are... you guessed it--geeks who were mentally prepared for the zombie apocalypse due to
 * the huge amounts of popular culture they absorbed. Finally their collections of slightly dull katanas, impractical-against-guns-but-practical-against-unarmed-combat suits of armour, collections of automatic and semi automatic weaponry, stockpiles of party foods like Mt. Dew have a purpose. The post zombie-population is full of nerds. As a result of that, fantasy nomenclature has taken over culture, especially now that it has became weirdly appropriate. Medical
 * doctors are healers, medical technicians keeping themselves alive are liches, while medical technicians who maintain one solitary X-ray machine in a 
 * fortified former hospital are regarded as oracles or seers. Those who retain wireless communication methods are thought of as limited telepaths who can
 * provide great services. Unfortunately for humanity, the application of these old world skills lends such incredible advantages to the individuals who possess them that it disincentivizes the teaching of their methods. If a radio-operator were to reveal that _anyone_ could operate his radio, then his spot in
 * the pecking order is threatened. Marketing himself as a guild member in the guild of telepaths (they send telegrams) he is ensuring his survival as a member
 * of this vital and respected network that facilitates communication across the shattered states. 
 *
 * Electricity is enormously important, and its scarcity drives many aspects of society. Sources have access to severely limited renewable sources of energy such
 * as wind, water, or solar energy, but they have to guard them fanatically. A windmill with a power converter is an extremely coveted resource, and giving 
 * indications of vulnerability could give local warlords dangerous ideas. Transmuters have power generators that are gas operated (or maybe even nuclear in a really unsafe way); they can provide energy, but only if you have the requisite materials of course. And you have your looters and scavengers searching for any
 * AA or car batteries that might have escaped the degradation of everything.
 *
 * There are almost no working cars remaining. Nearly everyone who owns one is a member of the Fraternity of Ferrymen. Most people simply ride horses, but motor powered forms of transportation mean a many fold decrease in the time it takes to travel. To the commoners it appears like the Engimporer can effectively teleport, as his airplane is one of the last and a closely guarded secret. Travel down interstate highways can be extremely fast; the highways are empty for miles (most cars were pushed away and looted at one point or another; wrecked cars were a convenient source of metal to be melted down into weaponry) it isn't uncommon for a Ferryman to drive you at 120 mph for your entire trip--he can serve more trips that way. The Assembly of Auto Assemblers works closely with the Fraternity of Ferrymen to maintain the last cars.
 *
 * For the large part knowledge trumps almost everything in this world. Even the greatest warlord doesn't dare to mess with guilds, because the utility they 
 * provide is just too great. For the most part gold has returned as the currency of exchange. Coins are still accepted in many places, but they carry only
 * a fraction of the value they did, now that they are only worth the intrinsic value of the metal in the coin. Paper money is used for all sorts of purposes
 * but never for purchasing anything.
 *
 * People with firearms bill themselves out in various ways, and are never short on work. Pyromancers are simply people with flamethrowers, or access to explosives (a convincing fireball goes a long way to solidifying a reputation as a sorcerer). 
 *
 * Well, I got thirty minutes left today and I'm running out of energy here. I think the majority of food is provided by farms which are hand harvested. Unfortunately, farmers are already a dwindling group so in the future they are all gone. With nobody knowledgeable enough to operate the farm machinery food production has slipped back into the 18th century, and as a result food would be scarce if people weren't. The Engimporer (okay, that sounds a bit stupid, I'm definitely changing it. But Engineer-Emperor is a bit bland). Meh, I'm too tired to think about all this.
 *
 * Hot damn, this is actually an amount of writing. I mean, I haven't written this much in a while. Sweet. Nothing like having something you absolutely should
 * be doing instead to motivate you to write--if you are me, that is.  I might start using this as a writing technique when I'm at home too. Switching
 * between programming and coding is pretty therapeutic.

Panel 1.

Mrs. Ramsay: But what have I done with my life? They had that--Paul Rayley and Minta Doyle--I, only this. He's frowning. What at? I don't know. I don't mind. I don't understand I had ever felt any emotion or affection for him.

Panel 2.

"William, sit by me."
"Lily, over there."
"Sit there please."

Narrator: She had a sense of being past everything, through everything, out of everything, as she helped the soup, as if there was an eddy--there--and one could be in it, or one could be out of it, and she was out of it. And meanwhile she waited, passively, for some one to answer her, for something to happen. 

Mrs. Ramsay: It's all come to an end.

Mrs. Ramsay: But this is not a thing that one says.

Panel 3.

Narrator: "Raising her eyebrows at the discrepancy—that was what she was thinking, this was what she was doing—she felt, more and more strongly, outside that eddy; or as if a shade ad fallen, and, robbed of colour, she saw things truly. The room was very shabby. There was no beauty anywhere. She forebore to look at Mr. Tansley. Nothing seemed to have merged. They all sat separate. And the whole of the effort of merging and flowing and creating rested on her. Again she felt, as a fact without hostility, the sterility of men, for is she did not do it nobody would do it, and so, giving herself the little shake that one gives a watch that has stopped, the old familiar pulse began beating, as the watch begins ticking—one, two, three, one, two, three. And so on and so on, she repeated, listening to it, sheltering and fostering the still feeble pulse as one might guard a weak flame with a newspaper. 

Panel 4.

Narrator: Poor man! who had no wife, no children, and dined alone in lodgings except for tonight; and in pity for him, life being now strong enough to bear her on again, she began all this business, as a sailor not without weariness sees he wind fill his sail and yet hardly wants to be off again and thinks how, had the ship sunk, he would have whirled round and round and found rest on the floor of the sea.

Mrs. Ramsay: "Did you find your letters? I told them to put them in the hall for you."

Panel 5. (Insert after panel 3)

Narrator: Lily Briscoe watched her drifting into that strange no-man's land where to follow people is impossible and yet their going inflicts such a chill on those who watch them that they always try at least to follow them with their eyes as one follows a fading ship until the sails have sunk beneath the horizon.

Lily: How old she looks, how worn she looks, and how remote. What a change just now. 

Narrator: Then when she turned to William Bankes, smiling, it was as if the ship had turned and the sun had struck its sails again.

Lily: Why does she pity him? 

Narrator: That was the impression she gave. Poor William Bankes, she seems to be saying, as if her own weariness had been partly pitying people, and the life in her, her resolve to live again, had been stirred by pity.

Lily: It was not true.

Narrator: It was one of those misjudgments of hers that seemed to be instinctive and to arise from some need of her own rather than of other people's. 

Lily: He is not in the least pitiable. He has his work.

Narrator: She remembered, all of a sudden as if she had found a treasure, that she had her work. In a flash she saw her picture.

Lily: "Yes, I shall put the tree further in the middle; then I shall avoid that awkward space. That's what I shall do. That's what has been puzzling me.

= Globalization to the Max =
Globalization to the Max: Bringing a Digital Utopia to Earth

Globalization is the trend of increased connectedness between people. So if globalization were carried out to its limits, what would result? Currently, technology has connected distant people to a new extent--but people can still be 'distant'. The limitations of our physical space chain us to a system of localism. However, if humanity were to collectively upload their consciences into a simulated universe where people are physically connected to people as people are digitally connected to people on the internet, then humans could achieve absolute globalism. In such a world we could be perfect cosmopolitans; no one is bound to a fate by the body they were born in, no one is limited by a poor birthplace. 
Mind uploading is the process of scanning the physical state of a brain, and then simulating the operation of the brain on a computer model. This is already a possibility. In December 2006 IBM and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology's Blue Brain project successfully simulated the neocortical column of a rat.[1] Henry Markram, the lead researcher at Blue Brain, said in 2009 that, "A detailed, functional artificial human brain can be built in the next 10 years."[2] Moore's Law, the famous prediction that processing power doubles every two years, predicts that we would have a computer with the processing power required to simulate a single human brain by 2025. Nick Bostrom calculated that simulating the brains of every person that has ever lived would require from 10^33 to 10^36
Instead, I will explore how a digital universe should be constructed to benefit humanity, and what the philosophical implications are on human identity.
In the simulated reality we create we must create the physics of the universe. These physics would likely be based off our own world's, but with some enhancements. Someone might object that living in a reality bound by arbitrary rules created by someone else is insulting. Perhaps, but since it is philosophically impossible to determine whether we are in a simulated reality right now, a simulation we create wouldn't be any worse. 
The first enhancements we should consider relate to personal identity. In the digital universe each person can craft their own avatar. This would eliminate physical disabilities, eliminate the feeling of being trapped in the wrong body by transgendered people, and make the idea of race irrelevant (but not culture). People should be allowed to continuously change their appearances, because if someone only got to choose once they might come to regret their choice.
This raises objections about personal identity. How would you stop someone from impersonating your friend? Well, one enhancement we can build into the universe is a unique ID assigned to each person. Anytime you are with someone you can view their ID, thus the idea of personal identity is perserved and enforced by the simulation.
We have, in a way, eliminated the unjust effects of the natural lottery in regards to our bodies, but we haven't addressed how we will eliminate the limits of locality. My proposal is that the simulation creates miniature universes for each user, which are completely shaped by the user's desires. If you know someone's ID then you can request to teleport to their universe, and they can choose to allow you access. Through this mechanism there is no notion of physical distance between any two individuals, they are connected in this network. 
In the simulated universe we should ensure that all users have access to the same computational power. If users were able to use their past physical wealth to purchase more computational power for themselves it would allow them to perceive subjective time slower. We ought to ensure that whenever the computational power of the simulated universe increases all users are provided equal shares of the increase.
We might wonder at this junction what concept of wealth might exist in this universe. Since people are more or less dieties in their personal universes, there is little use for money. There isn't anything to purchase or experience that couldn't be created out of thin air. The only remaining concept of wealth is that of information. A user can only create something they have seen or imagined. Thus, a user could create a piece of artwork, and then barter with another user for, say, a car. One user enter's the other's universe with the artwork in tow. Now the user with the car can duplicate the artwork, and the first user an duplicate the car.
Each person can feel free to pursue their passions to their fullest extent. They can then trade their expertise with others, and in this way everyone is enriched. It's the principle of specialization carried to its logical conclusion. Every person has unlimited time to develop an expertise. This would constitute a new era of human creativity. 
Some might question whether existance has any meaning here. I would argue that because of the artistic and creative freedom given to people that our lives would be more meaningful than ever. In the past people have strived for immortality. The people we consider most successful, such a William Shakespeare, are those who legacy lived on beyond them. Some portion of their original thought lived on in the sea of information. Being uploaded would guarantee your immortality. Not only would your conscience be immortal, but so would all of your ideas, which would live on in the simulation.
What of people who refuse to be uploaded? It's all the better that there are. There must remain people on the outside to maintain the facilities required to run the simulation. These people would be richly rewarded and afforded all material comforts. These physical resources are of no use to those inside, so they may as well be distributed among those few remaining on the outside. The children of the outsiders would be allowed inside if they so choose, thus providing new generations of minds inside the universe, to prevent it from becoming stagnant with aging minds.
The people on the outside can also act a regulatory mechanism to ensure that the simulation is never compromised by malicious individuals. Decisions to modify the simulation should be made by a joint council of outsiders and insiders to ensure the modification is beneficial to all. 
What if the outsiders decided to unpower the simulation? It would save them immense resources and further enrich themselves. I think the simulation would provide immense value to the outsiders that they wouldn't want to jeopardize. For example, an immense amount of creative individuals, such as filmmakers and writers, will be working inside the simulation. This would probably be the outsider's only source of new film and novels, because the outsiders have to work in fields such as nuclear engineering. Many people with creative instincts would want to join the simulation to carry out their work, rather than toil toward a practical field and live richly in the physical world. 
Does humanity have any greater purpose after devising a way for everyone to, essentially, create a heaven of their own choosing? I would say yes. Humanity still has a desire to spread its legacy ever farther. We would love to expose our ideas to as many minds as possible. After our ideas have spread to every human, we still wish to expand. To that end, humanity could live in the simulation for millions of years while traveling through space, until we encounter another form of intelligent life with which to share our culture, history, and experience. With time, alien minds could be integrated into the simulation. This would be cosmopolitan in the greatest sense of the word, we would be citizens of the cosmos sharing our ideas with citizens from other planets.
what purpose does humanity have anymore? to find other life and share our rich culture

= essay I reviewed for Kevin? =
Writer: Melate Tibebe
Reviewer: Kevin Zhou

II.

1. The thesis takes a stand on the meaning of the story, because it interprets the purpose of Thomas' character in the story. It provides specific detail in the theme statement about story telling and the context of the story. It identifies the literary technique of personification as key.

2. I thought the lead was a 5. Perhaps the historical context could be mentioned more specifically.

3.
Specific literary techniques used in the story are accurately identified. Evidence is provided, and each point is connected to the thesis.
The three main points are: 1) Thomas, like storytelling, is on trial 2) the gagging of Native American culture is also represented through Thomas 3) Thomas' imprisonment represents the oppression of Native Americans. They were easily identified, and appropriate and convincing. 
The paragraphs have topic sentences, which all introduce the main point of the paragraph. Some of them lack a connection to the thesis. The descriptions of Thomas' three stories is transitioned to chronologically, but it isn't explained how these relate to the thesis.
Yes, adequate context was provided for all quotations. Specific examples and quotations were a strong part of this essay, and all the picks were appropriate for strengthening the thesis. The examples and quotations weren't all fully explained, as I said earlier, it isn't clear how the descriptions of the three stories directly relates to the thesis.
Quotations are well integrated into the flow of text.
There is a good balance of evidence and interpretation.
The descriptions of the three stories strays from the topic. It should be better explained why those illustrate how Thomas is a personification.
The essay seemed focused and unified until the later portion, where the topic seemed to stray from the thesis.
The essay includes appropriate in-text citations. Page numbers are included.

4. The conclusion was a strength of this paper, it synthesized and revisited the thesis, and made the topic seem broader and more interesting.
I understand that Thomas was a representation of his people, and through story telling was able to pass forward the tradition, even though he was jailed.

III.
1. The main idea is that Thomas is a personification of Native Americans. This was a fairly convincing idea, and I think it adds a good layer of meaning to the story, so it is good literary analysis.
2. I was drawn in by the strong thesis.
3. The two most important revisions are to bring the last half of the paper in line with the first half of it. The second half strays from the thesis, and seem to be arguing different points. This revision is vital, because otherwise the paper will not be as focused. The next revision could be the structuring of the paragraphs. They are very close to being in chronological order, according to the story, but are slightly out of order. If that were changed, the logical flow of the essay might be clearer.

Writer: Shyam Iyer
Reviewer: Kevin Zhou

II.

1. The thesis takes a stance on the meaning of the story, because it interprets the way Thomas was written. It provides the specific detail that Thomas is portrayed through his story telling. Metaphors and symbolism are identified as the literary techniques used.
2. I would give this lead a 5, it goes into good detail. The introductoy sentence could be shortened to make it a more attractive hook with a stronger statement.
3. Yes, specific literary techniques used are identified, explained, and interpreted. There is plenty of evidence from the story, this was a strong point of the paper, and it was all well connected to the thesis. 
The three main points are: 1) Thomas is able to control the mood of the audience by telling of the ponies' demise, 2) Thomas could extend the story metaphorically to make it about war, and further affect emotions, 3) Thomas was able to manipulate the feelings of the judge, even if it wasn't to his advantage. They were easily identified, and appropriate and convincing. 
Paragraphs have topic sentences. On page 2 the transition into the paragraph about war is unclear. The purpose of this paragraph is explained later on in the paragraph, but should be explained leading up to it.
Adequate background information was provided.
The use of evidence in this paper was very strong, the choices of quotations were good. The quotations and examples are also given enough room to be fully explained. The quotations were well mixed into the paper, and read smoothly.
Because of the excellent amount of evidence in this paper, I would say that it strikes a good balance.
Nothing strays off topic. However, the focus and unity is less than it could be, perhaps because jumping from the section about the audience to the section about the judge is abrupt, and due to the problem I mentioned above with paragraph flow. This paper just needs better topic sentences and transitions.
The in-text citations were fine with page numbers and everything.
4.
It seems to primarily repeat the thesis. In my opinion, the conclusion needs the most work, and should bring this paper to a stronger close.
I understand that Thomas was able to captivate audiences with his storytelling.

III.

1. The main focus is on how the author depicts Thomas' ability to sway people with words. Perhaps it didn't give me a deeper understanding of the story itself, but it provided insight into the way the author used literary techniques to convey an idea, so it was good literary analysis.
2. The aspect that drew me into the essay was how well it cited the text to form the arguments.
3. The most important revisions are to fix the conclusion, and to improve the flow between paragaphs. Fixing the conclusion is important because I felt disappointed when I reached the conclusion, the rest of the paper is much stronger. Fixing the flow between paragraphs will help a lot to make the individually strong main points into a much stronger focused core of arguments.

= the towel critique =
The Towel is a story about a couple that visits Las Vegas deci-annually. Crucially we are told right from the beginning that the narrator, Cecil, feels stupid and out of place coming to the casinos, when everyone else there is young and out to get drunk. That, combined with the description of the thick smoke and flashing lights, creates a great sense of apprehension or discomfort in the first two pages. It makes the reader ready to expect the worst when it comes to the towel.
That aspect of the story works well, I think. I was caught by surprise, which was probably the intended effect. The ending does leave me with more questions than when I started the story, though.
There also seemed to be a plot hole, because in the ending it seems Cecil knew all along who was folding the towels. However, during the middle he says things like, "This made me think about it again, and it was starting to seem a little strange to me." That made the ending seem cheap, if that's the word, because the narrator was deceiving us about his own thoughts. If Cecil is supposed to be the one who planned it from the start, I think showing Edith's perspective would make more sense. Unless it's clear that Cecil was planning this, and we get to see his relish as Edith starts to fall for his tricks. Later he does say, "I pretend to rummage through our things, knowing that nothing will be missing," so the first instance might just be a mistake. Except in the ending "was not wearing the same clothes that we had seen on the rest of the maids in the building, leading me to conclude she did not in fact work there", (very wordy sentence) but then immediately after he says he knows Katrina. If his wife does too, why doesn't she recognize the name? "My job was done." At that point I didn't know what to think.
The dialogue could use a few general changes. I think the dialogue is mostly over explained in this story. Both characters are always stating reasons for what they want to do, and they leave very little unspoken. In a real conversation I feel there are a lot of unstated assumptions. Old couples seem to need to say very little to each other, because they already know the other person's reasons and such. There are also tense problems. The characters should be speaking in present tense. An example with both problems: "See Edith, you have nothing to worry about now. Nothing was different so I think the new keys work." The easy fix is leaving it at "...about now."
This story started falling apart at the end, but I think it was holding up well until then. My suggestion is to go through and make sure everything is consistent, and then revise the ending a lot. It's a crucial moment, and currently the reaction doesn't seem right.

Marcus saß im öffentlichen Bad, und den Dampf steigen sah. Er musste für heute Abend fertig sein. Man sollte nicht in Gegenwart der Götter schmutzig--aber man nicht in den Augen der Götter stehlen sollte. Nein, dieses Bad war für kühle der Nerven. Marcus trocknete sich ab, und zu seinem Haus ging, um seine Zeit abzuwarten. Nach Einbruch der Dunkelheit würde er handeln.

Marcus näherte sich dem Tempel aus dem heiligen Hain, wo die Olivenbäume vorgesehen sind. Er musterte seine Umgebung. Als er sicher war, dass er sicher war, bekam er seinen Enterhaken aus seinem Rucksack. Es war ein Fenster zehn pygon über ihm. Er warf die Enterhaken, und es auf dem Fensterbrett hakte. Er kletterte schnell bis das Seil. Als er auf das Fenster war, er zog das Seil heran und senkte es im Inneren. Er glitt vorsichtig, so er nicht stören die Priesterinnen würde. Er lief zum die Adyton durch die Säulenhalle. Er hatte seine Sandalen mit einem Tuch umwickelt, um das Geräusch seiner Fußstapfen zu dämpfen. In der Adyton, war sein Ziel nur da sitzen.

"Das ist interessant", sagte Marcus. Curse mein schlechtes Zeitwahl, dachte er. Es war ein plötzlicher Aufregung in der Plaza. Marcus drehte sich um und sah das Gefolge des Orakel kommen die Plaza an.
"Räumt den Weg für die Pythia, das Orakel von Delphi und die Hohepriesterin des Apollo", schrie ein Mensch. Wenn das Orakel der Mitte des Platzes erreicht, kletterte sie aus ihrem Sänfte.

= darkness in the coast critique =
Darkness on the Coast is a story about a girl, Atrox, who lived in a coastal estate with her negligent parents. Throught out the story we see instances of behavior that is very strange, from both the the parents and the servants. No one seems to have an interest in raising a child, or at least, an interest that is allowed to flourish under the supervision of Drummond.
One thing that I suggest is removing the use of adjectives when describing the scenery. At first they might seem like an effective way of setting a mood, but they are less evocative than straight detail. Adjectives in description are akin to 'telling' in narration. An example is in the second paragraph. "The skies were always the same depressing shade." We don't need to be told that this is depressing, a constant overcast gives us that feeling already. Adding other detail about the clouds could enhance the depressing feeling, without using the blunt instrument.
The dialogue was problematic to me. One quick mechanical thing: too many new paragraphs were being started when the same character was still speaking. Often one character's reaction is paired with another character's dialogue, which is the opposite of what's wanted. The reaction should start a new paragraph, because it is by a new actor.
Perhaps it's because there is so little dialogue in the beginning of the story, but I felt like Atrox's voice in dialogue was never very well established. So some lines she said simply caught me off-guard, and felt wrong on a visceral level. "Hey where are you going? I could stand a little more proselytizing," is an example. It seemed an inappropriate thing to say in the circumstances, but I also had no idea she talked like that. It seemed she didn't value self-preservation too highly during that exchange.
I found the ending very intriguing, although I haven't decided what to make of it yet. To a certain extent the Facilitator mocks the idea of a deeper-meaning, by trivializing the narrator's situation into one he can apply a boilerplate speech to. Based on her mother's comments before she dies, I think the story is trying for something, but it hasn't entirely come through yet.
Just how strong is Atrox, anyway? Seeing the way the creature ripped through Donovan I thought it was strong, but Atrox is able to throw around the creature with her arms? It seems strange to me that a couple so embroiled in dark arcana and so apathetic to children wouldn't have just gotten an abortion. Perhaps Prosperine genuinely loved her child at one point, but came to resent it after Donovan continually made her feel guilty. Or something. And man, eating a whole heart. A Game of Thrones by George RR Martin does that well, for reference.
Overall I enjoyed this story, my problems with it are mostly about the writing. At times in the beginning is felt melodramatic, but that's easily fixed by removing those adjectives.

"Das ist interessant", sagte Marcus. Curse mein schlechtes Zeitwahl, dachte er. Es war ein plötzlicher Aufregung in der Plaza. Marcus drehte sich um und sah das Gefolge des Orakel kommen die Plaza an.
"Räumt den Weg für die Pythia, das Orakel von Delphi und die Hohepriesterin des Apollo", schrie ein Mensch. Wenn das Orakel der Mitte des Platzes erreicht, kletterte sie aus ihrem Sänfte. Sie stand auf dem erhöhten Oratorium. Die Menge beruhigte, als sie zu sprechen begann. "Bürger, gab es einen Raubüberfall in den Tempel der Athena. Ich werde der Schwurgerichtsverfahren stattfinden morgen Mittag vorsitzen," sie sagte.

= Dynamo Issue 12 =
Dynamo Issue #112 is a story about two men, who used to be roommates and partners in writing comics. Greg runs an unsuccessful comic-book store, and Jim writes Dynamo, a new comic. Dynamo was a concept they created together, however Jim got solo patronage from the publisher, leaving Greg to wallow in self-pity. Jim, too, is suffering in misery due to the guilt he feels about abandoning Greg.
The major weakness of the story is it skirts around those issues, and instead deals with mundane daily events and irrelevant references. Many stories which deal with this theme, betrayal for the sake of success, are extremely successful, but they deal closely with the betrayal and its after effects.
The time frame of this story is set wrong, I feel. Either the story could deal with the moment of the perceived betrayal, or deal with the moment of the confrontation. Right now there is just a whole lot of lead up to the confrontation, but the tension isn't exactly increasing throughout the story. The confrontation we are lead up to is disappointing too.
The dialogue can use a lot of work. In the very beginning we are already lost as to who is speaking, until the end of the conversation. The dialogue is unpunctuated, because there are many clauses run together (I've marked them on the draft). The voices are also indistinct and inconsistent. On p. 2 Greg says "wanna" but on p. 1 he's saying "does not", similarly Trent says "kinda" but seems to mostly avoid contractions. The diction is odd too. Why "acquiescing" and "serendipity"? I can't get a grip on how these characters speak.
The time transitions as we move between narrators got confused too. We have "The next morning" and then "Meanwhile". But then "Earlier", which I have to take as being relative to the "Meanwhile", but that would mean earlier in the morning, except he is calling his dealer at 10:30pm, so that isn't right. Also, in "The next day" it is 7:30pm but "Sometime later" is in the morning when Trent comes in. There is a lot of time fast-forwarding that occurs, "the rest of the shift is draped in silence. When I get home".
While I can appreciate the references being made as a way to enhance the theme of the story, I think details need to give the reader a better sense of the place and the characters. Nearly everyone likes Firefly, so being incredibly specific about the disk and episode of Firefly that Jim watches isn't helpful, for instance.
This story has a lot of potential, and you should draw that potential out. Try writing this story using no cultural references and draw out the drama of the conflict. Greg is poor, which is stressful. Jim feels guilty. Play on the universal themes and write a good story first, then you can add any references that fit. 
= 1917 =

1917 is a story about  a young school girl who transfers schools from Russia. Complicating things, she is mute and her guardian is a vampire. Initially she is unhappy, but later she feels a sense of belonging there, which she had never felt before.
From textual hints the reader infers 1917 has a semi-magical world, and this effect is done well. However, I felt there were two problems related to this. 
First, curiosity regarding the world building shouldn't be the reader's only motivation for reading. I didn't feel the build up of dramatic tension in this story, but there were ample opportunities. Mia is amazingly nonplussed by everything, all things considered. Her nervousness regarding her new classmates could 've been played up. The reader should feel concerned for Mia when she is questioned by the school mistress. What if they dislike each other, and her entire school year gets off to a bad start? When she meets her new roommate, the reader should be anxious. If Chesa is mean, then the school year will be miserable.
Second, some of the fantastical elements didn't advance the story. Yulian is a vampire, Mia has been bitten. But the only ramification is Mia has to wear a scarf inside. This is related to the first point. The reader be scared for Mia when she is asked to remove her scarf. Some things, like the telepathic boy were simply confusing. I never learned what that was about, and he defuses what could've been an amazingly awkward situation. Overall, I would like to see more of an arc to the story, and for more of the story elements to create tension.
There were smaller issues, concerning the description. At the beginning, describing everything as black just makes the reader wonder how anyone can see. Particularly when Mia see Yulian waving in the distance, with a black glove against a dark forest. Also, carriages are loud and bumpy, but their's wasn't. Is it magical? I've ridden in a horse drawn carriage before, and they make more noise than "scratching the gravel". They are also bumpy. There are other problems, which I've marked on the draft.
It was confusing that the reader doesn't learn Mia is mute until page three. If I were mute I'd be thinking about it constantly before moving to a new school. I thought the translator was for Russian. How were Mia and Yulian talking, then? I'd imagined her speaking, on my first read.
Overall, I think the only real issue is the first person perspective needs to be fully realized. There is too much retrospection, instead of in the moment thinking. We never learn why she feels compelled to walk in the dark, for instance. The issues I raised at the start, relating to the tension in this story, are directly caused by this. If the narrator plays up scenes as tense, then the reader feels tension.

= Love Letter =
Love Letter is an innocuously named story about a hog factory processor by day, serial killer by night. Told in the form of a letter to his dead mistress, this story follows the narrator as he seduces Denice, a stripper, with a gift of her clients, bond and gagged. After butchering them with a hunting knife they kick off a wild romance.
Not being a sociopath myself I can't claim to know the thought pattern of a serial killer. That said, I felt unconvinced by the end of the story. Neither the narrator nor Denice felt entirely real to me. I'll start with Denise, because she is an easier case.
Part of it is the narrator's objectification of Denise, which is a good deliberate effect, but does make it harder to feel out her character. In some critical moments the description is disappointingly unvaried, e.g. "coy smile", "winked at me coyly", "a little sarcastically", "light sarcasm[sic] streak", "Coy and aware". Her acts of flirtation, "brushing your titties against my arm and touching my hand and thigh", is also used more than once. Denice also seemed altogether too willing. I felt she should have been more used to her clients badgering her than her sarcasm hinted at--why would she even drink at the same bar where she works? It's inviting trouble.
On the narrator's part, I never got a sense for why he was doing what he did. To same degree there seems to be class conflict. He works in a slaughterhouse, and he views the wealthy fatcat with contempt. But he also calls his killings a hobby. And he's obviously mixed his killings in with dreams of domestication in a troubling way. Was it the hellish environs of his work that drove him to madness? He references having been to hell, but it's unclear what he means. You don't need to be obvious, but I was searching and didn't find any concrete clues. He hates Denice's clients, but he can hardly claim any moral highground, given his presense in the titty bar. 
I think you might have originally written this as a letter addressed to someone else, but about Denice, because there are a couple of places where you switch to third person when referring to Denice, like "touching her smooth as butter skin". I've noted other instances in my notes on your draft.
Characterization aside, there is a lot to like about this story. I'm guessing this story is influenced by "Where Will You Go When Your Skin Cannot Contain You?" and the use of disconcerting imagery is mostly well done (the theme of pigs is overdone). Some of the subtle details, "Sorry you had to wear sunglasses for so long", hint at the troubled nature of their relationship beyond the particular scene. More of that would be good. Lastly, the letter didn't seem very apologetic, even though it seems like it should be.

Ask HN: Help a Highschooler with His Resume

I'm looking for a job or internship to hack at this summer. I'd like to get feedback from this group, because I'd enjoy being at a start-up or similarly challenging technical environment. 

Right now my resume is tailored more to seeking a typical summer internship at a large company, I feel, but I'd like to know what you want to see more of. I was weighing mentioning skills like Rails and Node.js but I feel like just about anyone can claim experience. I'm leaning towards only listing skills I can currently demonstrate with a code sample. 

To that purpose I'm working on open sourcing a handful of the components I've written for my project/start-up idea. The first of these is a high accuracy sentence tokenizing library, but it's of limited use until I release the HTML text sanitizer that goes along with it. (The full capability is taking Markdown or Textile and tokenizing those into fully formed sentences with the markup intact. There is a good amount of contextual logic that makes sure inline <code> and such niceties are recognized as part of the sentence, and correctly interpreting links, etc.)

I'm still working on open sourcing more of my code, but meanwhile I think I need to get into the job market for this summer. What do you think I should do?

Dear Dr. Moses,

Happy New Year. I wanted to thank you again for writing me the letters of recommendation and let you know what the results so far have been. I've been admitted to Case Western Reserve University, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and, of course, U of MN. I was also deferred at U of Chicago and MIT. I'll also be applying to Brown, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and Dartmouth. I think I have a strong application to the deferrals and the new schools, because I just completed a very successful semester. 

Just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your help. I don't think I could have done it without great recommenders. 
= letter to recommenders =
The Common Application lets you do this recommendation form once and
have it sent to many colleges. I'd say it is quick and convenient, but
my school counselor says it is slightly annoying. There is a short
instructional video 

https://schoolforms.commonapp.org/CommonApp/CommonAppDemo.aspx?src=T 

that should help. 

One issue I know will arise is that they ask for a CEEB code for the
school you teach at. Since the University of Minnesota isn't a
secondary school, it won't show up there, so after searching you
should click the "Not found" link (the video shows where this is) and
fill in the address information for the University of Minnesota. That is

Sorry this is such a hassle, and thank you in advance for your help.
= alternate proofs in today's class =
Dear Professor Lawson,

I was wondering about the role group actions played in today's proofs. It seemed like all the results that were proved in class today were possible much earlier in the course. Particularly in the second homework we proved that a group with order p^k had an element of order p, which gives us our results for p^2 as well. Aren't we able to prove all p-groups have non-trivial centers without any reference to group actions by using infinite descent on the normalizer of a subgroup? 

Are orbits and group actions just more convenient ways to think about existing methods, or are they a lot more useful on groups with strange orders (and just applied to p^k for demonstration, I guess)? Maybe I'm just feeling confused because I was looking ahead, so these results seem familiar.

Pedicord Apartments

The first time I closed the door--dull brass room "6"--I took my dreams to a quiet alley and shot them, gently. The door stands in the damp brown hallway. I drag through the fetid carpet every evening knowing a whip smart journalist lies dead in a trash bin. Instead, I work in an assembly line. My job is to fit a gear into an assembly, 6,000 times a day. My boss's job is to fit flesh gears into a corporate assembly, slightly fewer times a day. 

Sometimes as I'm pulled through that hallway by tedious routine I hear sounds through the other doors. Those numbers were people once too. People. People who've been smothered by those doors. The only remnants of their existence are the muffled sounds of struggle against doloroum. We reside within 6 feet of each other, but we are blind mutes too timid to be found. Through the door across me I can hear a woman sobbing, but she doesn't want to be found. To be found would mean confessing.

Confessing everything I've just confessed. The shame of unmet expectations, of failure, of meritocracy. The desperation of day to day delving. But I've been found, Officer Mort pulled me out of a trash bin today.

My math team participation is my most meaningful commitment, because it is my deepest interest, and I work very hard to promote the activity among my peers. 

We are interested in learning more about you and the context in which you have grown up, formed your aspirations and accomplished your academic successes. Please describe the factors and challenges that have most shaped your personal life and aspirations. How have these factors caused you to grow? (800 word limit)

When I was growing up my parents spent three years doing mission work in Taiwan. This put my family under a lot of financial duress, as we weren't receiving much support from any church in the United States to do our work. My parents worked to maintain a small church run out of our apartment building, while also working just to feed the family. During this period I believe I developed my strong value system. My parents were perfect examples of altruism. They gave up whatever they had to in order to do something they believed in. I was very strongly effected by their principled behavior. I also learned much from Banchiao. It was a hard place, smokey, cramped, and humid, but everyone preservered. I began to internalize the Taiwanese work ethic. Everyone there would just do what they had--they were part of a family, and in a family each person supported the other by doing their task, whether it be working in the family business or studying. I also admired the entreprenurial spirit of the Taiwanese summed up by one of their proverbs, "better to be the head of a chicken than the tail of a cow". 

When we returned to the United States, now heavily in debt, I began really expanding my knowledge. My family homeschooled, so I was essentially free to learn as I desired. Given this opportunity I did not squander it. I knew my family couldn't afford many things, so I made good use of my local resources. I lived only a mile and half away from a public library, and I would go there nearly daily. There were multiple instances when I hit the hundred book limit on my library. I was reading voraciously, in whatever subject. I especially loved to read literature. At this time I learned how to "learn outside the classroom", so to speak, because I had no classroom. To this day, I still supplement every class I take with extensive reading of extra material that I can obtain through the library or internet. 

While I pursued this free-form style of learning there was another factor at play. Shortly after we got back to America my grandfather slipped on some ice and was completely paralyzed.

= Eden =
John sat atop a small mound, sitting on grass so thick that it had taken on a silk texture. At one point there was a car beneath where he was sitting. Perhaps there still was, he thought as he looked into the early morning sky. Nearby the windmill stood lazily, its outstretched arms groaning under the weight of clingy leafy vines. Off in the distance the old church stood, robed in ivy. At something pretty close to seven o'clock the church bell intoned deeply, and then the belfry seemed to shudder for an instant before hundreds of disturbed doves exploded out the bell chamber. The birds flew in a spiral of feathers and communal confusion, then settled down just in time for the second ring to redisturb them.

At the sound of the bell John's son, Mark, approached the windmill from their homestead. John nodded at him, and Mark began his daily chore. Mark tucked the machete he was carrying into his belt and jumped up and grabbed hold of the lowest windmill blade. He pulled himself up by the vines and climbed up, ripping out handfuls of leafs as he went. The windmill creaked uneasily, but did not move its stationary blades. After a while Mark reached the top blade and spent some time looking around. He then went to work with the machete, cutting roots and vines off the verticle blades as he descended. The plant growth came off in big patches, peeling off onto the ground like a second skin. Finally, after Mark had climbed down, did the windmill start to turn lazily in the wind. Now they could have flour. By the next morning, Mark would have to do it all again.

= plans =
My plans:

I aim to be an entrepreneur in computer technology, and with luck retire early, or less work for a long time on very interesting projects. There are only a couple hubs in the country for start-up technology. Boston and Silicon Valley are the two most important locations. Stanford in particular is the place to be to get involved in an emerging business. Other like minded programmers congregate at Stanford, and most of the technologically interesting companies (in my opinion) in the US are born at Stanford. These include not only Stanford but also Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, Sun, eBay, Electronic Arts, Nvidia, VMware, Netflix, Silicon Graphics, and others. Stanford is the best place in the world to find co-founders for any technology startup. 

Besides that, Stanford is also on the cutting edge of research in technology related fields. More importantly Stanford seems good at applying new research to pratical applications. 

= OHS forums =
Dear Dr. Scarborough, 

In this email I'm going to go provide some more detailed recommendations concerning the OHS forum. I have high hopes for what this can accomplish, and I'd really like the school to do this well. It's a bit late for me to reap the benefits of this project, but I really much want this for future students.

Now... philosophically, this probably goes against a lot of what's presented in DFRL. In fact, this probably makes a wonderful basis for setting up a brutal dictatorship, and I wouldn't be too surprised if the Iranian Revolutionary Guard employed lots of these techniques. Fortunately enough for the OHS students our eventual goal is to create a self-perpetuating and self-governing community that it is unnecessary to monitor--not to mind control the students into submitting to our control. Thus the period of social engineering and close maintenance will be fairly. 

1. Make sure the interface is usable

A lot of the websites at OHS are ugly and hard to use. My personal view is that this is what results from using corporate cruft. Those large lumbering companies like Pearsons simply don't understand how to create good software. From both a user interface perspective and a programming perspective corporate software products are a blight.

Please make sure you use a Free Open Source Software (FOSS) forum package, and not some horrific contract-bound corporate Frankenstein. Both the Gnome Public License and the MIT License (the two most common open source licenses) are extremely open, and will be more than suitable for OHS's use. My personal recommendation for forum software is Vanilla. In my experience creating a forum for ImpishIdea I've tested six different forum interfaces. Vanilla wins hands down in terms of user experience and easy administration. It's featureful but still minimalist, which is exactly what good software should be. If there's anything that Apple demonstrates it is that people enjoy elegant software.

(Sidenote: The empty restaurant effect

The empty restaurant effect is your worst enemy. The effect is pretty easy to describe. An empty diner is unfriendly, and given a choice between an empty diner and a busy diner, people choose the busy diner. Not only do people feel self-conscious being the first people to enter a diner, they also think the diner must be empty for a reason. Their reasoning will be that the diner is empty because no one likes it.

Forums operate the same way. If a forum looks like a ghost town, no one will join it, and it will remain a ghost town. Solutions to mitigate this effect will be discussed below.)

2. Community foundation

There are two means of crafting a community. One is selecting the members of the community, the other is social engineering. Insofar as the first is out of our control here, we'll focus on the second point. 

People fundamentally take their cues from their surroundings, so the easiest way to create a precedent in a person's mind is to carefully arrange their surroundings upon arrival. Realistically speaking, it isn't feasible to control the community once you have too many members. So this is launch plan for a new forum.

First Phase: 

Gather your devoted volunteers. These volunteers must be aware of their mission: to establish a forum culture. In the first week (or two) the volunteers must undertake a conscious (and often artificial seeming) effort to write well. These volunteers are to purposfully create thought-provoking discussions, interesting replies, be ridiculously polite and wellspoken, act welcoming and open-minded, and do all these tasks in quantity. This task would be impossible to ask of normal members, but these volunteers are no normal members. They must understand that they are doing this for the good of the entire future community, and understand the rationale behind this. 

The participants should amongst themselves to plan out intricate conversations they will have on the forums to create the impression that these discussions were spontaneous. They should fake conflicts, but then end the conflicts with peaceful and amicable reconcilliations. For any given situation, the examplary response should already be laid out. 

Second Phase:

After the initial phrase, you are ready to announce the forum to the general public. Thanks to your meticulous work before hand, your new members will have an existing environment from which to model their own behavior. In the first phase you craft the community you would create if you had absolute control. In the second phase, this will begin to self-perpetuate. Of course, there will be an element of decay as more of the new members join, which is why the continual participation of the seed group will be important. Those members will remain to serve as examples to the community, and as enforcers.

In discussing this second phase I'll go into greater detail about what the forum should have. Note that most of what I describe should be set up in the first phase. 

Important forum threads

The following threads are threads that exist in one form or another on every functional forum, and serve to collect material that would otherwise create off-topic distractions in other threads. Or they may serve important facillitory functions within the forum. 

The introductions thread

This thread is to be stickied (permenantly placed at the top) and should be the first thread a new user posts in. The introduction thread is by definition an "off-topic" thread, where beginning new conversations within it tolerated. The introduction thread is where people should meet their fellow forum members, so it is acceptable to start conversatioons there.

First phase: The seeders should establish a precedant for interesting introductions. They should also greet each other heartily and being ongoing conversations right in this thread. Back and forth discussion with multiple parties displaying interest in each other is great.

Second phase: As the new users introduce themselves the seeders should welcome them, as practiced. The goal is to make the new users feel like one of the seeders right from the start. The more group identity they feel with the welcoming seeder group, the more they will conform with the acceptable behavior exhibited by the seeder group. While welcoming the new members and striking up conversation, the seeders can include useful advice in a friendly "older brother" sort of way. 

"Hey there <member>, hope you enjoy your time here. I think it's awesome that you like Passion Pit, they are one of my favorite bands too. What's your favorite song by them? Also--be sure to make sure your punctuation is correct. Some people can get a little cranky about it."

(Sidenote: "Some people"

Blaming rules on "some people" is a great technique. Those people don't actually have to exist, but the mere myth of their existence is sufficient. By creating this concept of "some people" who could concievably be annoyed at a rules violation you create a way to introduce rules to new members while simultaneously making it look like you _aren't_ a rules stickler. The seeders are to appear cool, not under the control of the administration, and relaxed about the rules--but trust them, you want to follow them anyway, to avoid trouble from "some people".)

The feedback thread

In this thead, you take suggestions for improvement from the members. This thread is also to be stickied. That you listen to your members is one of the most important things to do. When issues are brought up you should address them promptly and directly. Either begin work on the requested feature (and finish it), or explain why it can't be done immediately but thank them for the idea nonetheless.

First phase: Actually, this is the among the least artificial of the seeder group tasks. They are your beta testers, so the issues they bring up will be very legitimate. This is useful because they can help eliminate the most annoying of issues before the general populace is exposed to them.

Second phase: No big difference. 

The feedback thread is really your responsibility to respond to as a good community leader. If the users don't feel that you are listening to their problems, they feel disenfranchised. (Much like people who voted for the Democrats! Ba-dum-tish). 

The joy thread and the complaint thread

Both threads are to facillitate dual purposes. The first purpose is to create feeling that the forum is somewhere where you can share all your triumphs and disappointments. The second purpose is that people will invariably want to talk about these things anyway, and we'd rather have that discussion happen in the designated area than in a thread where it would be off-topic. 

The complaint thread (known as "The Bitch About Everything Thread", "Minor Quibbles", "Annoyances", etc.)

The particular incarnation of the complaint thread will vary from forum to forum. "Minor Quibbles", however, is my favorite incarnation. Alomst every complaint thread is pretty lighthearted complaints about some small thing like homework, having to miss a party because of a conflict, losing an iPod, or similar issues. The "Bitch About Everything" incarnation leads to, well, bitching. The "Minor Quibble" incarnation tends to help people keep in perspective. It is, after all, a minor quibble. 

This thread is important to every successful forum. Let's face it, complaining is a human instinct. It's best that instinct be channeled. 

First phase: The seeders should simply establish a baseline for what appropriate complaining. Calling teachers retarded because they assigned a lot of homework, for example, is probably off limits. Complaining about a particular week where they have three papers piled up, is pretty normal. The "Minor Quibbles" thread is a great place to build communal feeling during a busy finals week. Everyone can see that they aren't alone in having a terribly stressful week, and mutual suffering tends to build connections. 

Second phase: Seeders should provide commiseration and sympathy for any quibbles members have. Their own participation in terms of posting quibbles is strictly optional. 

The joy thread (known as "Express Your Joy", "Share Your Triumphs", "Daily Victories", etc.)

The same concept as the complaint thread, except that instead of telling stories of annoyances, the stories are about happy topics. Examples include: the great deal you got on a pair of jeans, the excellent grade youo got in an assignment, a sports victory, getting a girl's phone number, baking a delicious pie, etc.

Both of these threads are off-topic threads. It's fine for people to converse within about a particular occurence.

The random thread (known as "Everything Else", "Ignoble Random Thread", "Chaotic Conversations")

A lot of people will have things they want to say that won't fit easily into any particular thread or category, and will need an avenue of release for that. The random thread, then, is just a place where nearly anything (within the rules of decency) can be said. The random thread is, by definition, off-topic. 

First phase: Seeders should establish a lot of "random" conversations, but about fairly intelligent issues. Hopefully the seeders will have enough spontaniety between them to do this, because it is pretty hard to fake. Otherwise, they can just do whatever they like. 

Second phase: Anything goes, within the limits of decent behavior. It's just a conduit for silliness. 

The rules thread

A Crafty Guide to College Writing

There are an abundance of existing collegiate writing guides already, some of which are even excellent. So then, why do we yet another guide? Because those other guides do things wrong.

h2. Focus

Most guides aim for a breadth of knowledge. They are expensive enough so that you would only ever want to own one of them at a time (if even), so they'd best contain all the answers you might conceivably need. This guide is free, and the answer to any question it can't answer should be "searched":http://google.com for elsewhere. 

This allows _focus_ on the key topics, concepts, and techniques that are actually relevant to the vast majority of students, instead of saturating you with an abundance of inapplicable information.

h2. Relevance

This ties in with the previous point; in their quest to answer every possible question many guides still fail to answer the most relevant questions concerning a modern student, such as the appropriate use of Wikipedia in research, among other modes of conducting research.

h2. Indepth Study

Unlike many other guides, this book is not meant so much as a reference manual but as a self contained course on paper writing.

Table of Contents

The Process--they essay as a pain (in the ass).

The Hypothesis--the essay as a question.

The Structure--the essay as a conversation.

The Paragraph--the essay as a persuasion.

The Source--the essay as a presentation.

The Sentence--the essay as a whole.


h1. The Process--the essay as a pain (in the ass).

Writing an essay is a lot of work, and yes, it's a pain in the ass.

That's self evident.

Fortunately, it gets easier. It's fortunate because I'm lazy.

Great, a sloth leading a sloth. That's as bad as the blind leading the blind.

You say that, but the blind don't have the power of retrospection. You can learn a lot by looking back at the trail of mayhem and destruction you leave behind.

We are talking about papers here, Attila.

Right. One thing I've learned is that to be lazy you have to _do things the seemingly time consuming way_. The savings are long term.

I'm interested, what exactly is the time consuming way.

Well, you've got to write _at least_ *three* drafts.

Three? Bull.

Yes, three. And you've got to substantially rewrite with each draft too. It's a lot of work, isn't it? But writing gets easier the more you write.

I'm finding it easier and easier to disbelieve you.

Any way you cut it, a finished essay is a product of your time. Generally the more time you've spent, the better it will be. But that doesn't mean you can spend less time doing it more efficiently, if you know how. Three drafts, is one way.

Okay, but you've given me no information so far.

Yeah, I just wanted to get you ready for how much work this is going to be. Writing papers isn't easy. If it were, nobody would have to take freshman comp. Let's get started then.

h1. The Hypothesis--the essay as a question.

If we ignore our metaphor of an essay being a pain, what else can we think of an essay being?

...I don't know?

Exactly. An essay starts with a question and ends with an answer. Since professors tend to be pretentious the question gets called a 'hypothesis'.

Hold on a second, I thought the hypothesis was the statement I argue for.

That's one way to think of it, but doing it like that is _hard_.

How do you figure?

When you are asked to write an essay (I'm assuming you get to pick your hypothesis) you've got to pick a hypothesis that is non-trivial--something people wouldn't just know (common knowledge), something interesting, something that can be argued. 

Right.

So the topic is globalization. If you think of the hypothesis as an answer, then try to think of some hypothesises.

China is benefiting massively from globalization.

That's common knowledge. 

Workers in China have poor working conditions.

Also common knowledge. We can read the newspaper.

Um... Chinese automakers have been given a chance to expand?

Yes! A question. Do you start to see? When you think of the hypothesis as an answer, then you are only able to come up with hypothesises you already knew. But a hypothesis you already knew without having to research is _uninteresting_. However, just about any question you have can become a hypothesis. Once you answer the question you can change it to the answer style teachers like. So let's start with

bq. Have Chinese automakers expanded their overseas markets as a result of globalization?

as an example. Let's say the answer to the question is no. Then your Hypothesis-Answer is just

bq. Chinese automakers have not expanded their overseas markets as a result of globalization.

Viola.

Hm. I guess that worked. It still seems a bit crazy though.

In fact, it would be crazy, except that it has even more benefits.

Yeah?

Yeah. This method helps you weed out weak hypothesises that are too broad, general, or just plain dumb.

Okay, so?

Let's go back to the example we had of our hypothesis, back in question form.

bq. Have Chinese automakers expanded their overseas markets as a result of globalization?

Try and answer the question. What's the problem?

I can't really give a yes or no answer. It depends on the company and the time span. It's a stupid question.

Right you are. Our hypothesis needs to be narrow enough for us to answer. 

bq. Has <Chinese automaker> expanded its overseas markets as a result of globalization?

The time span we can narrow down because we know approximately when globalization became a global trend. So this is a better hypothesis.

Cool, so I can just go asking whatever questions?

Well, not quite.

Now what?

Maybe I should have mentioned this in the Process section--there are two phases of reading you should do for your hypothesis.

Gah, why?

Sometimes you still manage to ask stupid questions. Say you were writing a paper on math (you wouldn't be, but I'm a math major, so bear with me on these examples) and you wondered "Could two perfect cubes add up to a third perfect cube?" because you've been curious about that. 

This is contrived.

Moving right along, you might think, "Great, now I'll just turn this into Hypothesis-Answer form" and you go to look up the answer. The answer is that two cubes can never add up to a third cube. So you type merrily away at this paper of yours, until some math student walks by and smacks you silly.

What the f--?

That was a bad hypothesis, you idiot.

Wait a second, I didn't even come up with that stupid idea and you are calling me an idiot? 

Just play along.

Why was it a bad hypothesis?

Because any math major will tell you that what you've asked about is just part of Fermat's Last Theorem, and your hypothesis is actually common knowledge to them. If you were writing this for a math class your peers would be awfully bored.

This is lame. Not only do I have to not write any common knowledge *I* know, but I also have to avoid any common knowledge someone else might know? How am I even supposed to predict what they will know?
