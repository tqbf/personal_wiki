Man, things sure do get complicated once the UI team is involved. I guess they are kind of sloppy as far as methodology goes, or at least, that is just my opinion of it.

Man, I am sort of bored right now. Last night I had a pretty intense meditative experience again for thirty minute. My third eye has definitely been acting up, but I don't exactly know what is up with it right now. I'm not quite sure what to do for this support ticket, so I'm just going to waste some time here, before I get to more work on it.
