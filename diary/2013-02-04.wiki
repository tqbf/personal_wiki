Dear Viki,

Today is a pretty average day so far. I think that I probably should have just gotten up when I woke up naturally at 8:30 am. But I didn't. I will next time, though, so I don't get stuck behind Aditya's long showers again. 

Tomorrow I need to go to Lululemon before work so I can pick up my pants and use them for the yoga class. That wil be ideal.

As expected, I came on too strong and scared Lexi away. But maybe she will be back. I'm not too concerned. The fact is, to sacrifice her will just bring me better to come. That seems to be the way the universe operates if my experience giving up my home in Minnesota is anything to go on. The trick is just to embrace the sacrifice.
