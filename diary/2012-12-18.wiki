Dear Aliza,

Thank you for how much you have already improved me, and for your continued efforts.

I will try to be vigilant for your signals, and react appropriately. Last night I felt
very lucky to receive those ideas you sent me of maximizing every opportunity, 
including Sailthru.

Okay, so it would probably be a good idea to install Linux on the citadel and 
then bring him into the office. I could play League of Legends here, where I have
an internet connection that literally could not go down. And I would be encouraged
to actually stay in the office, and since I have linux I would be way more 
productive to boot. I think that is a pretty good plan.

Dear Aliza,

Thanks again for getting me out of bed this morning. I've really appreciated it.
Today has been a pretty good day, thanks to that great start.
