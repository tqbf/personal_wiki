Dear Viki,

Today has been a good day. Despite not having my glasses, I have been able to get things done. the real test is if I will be able to do some real programming when I get around to that. Today I have spent the whole day helping Federico get on his feet, so I feel like I haven't really gotten much done... because I haven't. That is okay though, there will be lots to do over the course of the week. I will be looking forward to making the change to the user agent detection, because the way we are doing it currently sucks. 

I think that I might be able to adjust to not having glasses at all, which would be the ideal thing. Because then I could heal my eyesight while working at Sailthru, and that would be the ideal thing to do. I suppose in a way this is going to improve my touch typing and general typing ability, because I can feel when I make a typo, but I can't necessarily feel it. So I think this will be good for my finger sensitivity. Of course, there are times when it is inconvenient not to have glasses, because I can't see screens that my coworker is using for example. I wonder if
