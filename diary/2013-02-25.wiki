Dear Viki,

Some cool ideas last night. I think I would like to be a part of a trifecta with
two beautiful women. Too ambitious? I'm sure I can manifest it. Just one step at
a time. Anything I want came come true if I put my mind to it. And I have decided
this is definitely more like what I want. I would like to find one partner and
then go tandem hunting with her for our other partner. That would be a lot of fun.

Anyway, I'm making progress in talking to people in the elevator. There was a 
cute girl in the elevator today along with a man. Because there were two people
I wasn't sure I was going to say hello and ask them how they were doing, but I 
did, and it seemed to cheer both of them up, so I'm really glad that I did.

I'm super bored right now, but that's okay, because pretty soon there will be 
lots of people in the office and I will be working. That's cool. I think the thing
I need to do is establish my guiding principles.
