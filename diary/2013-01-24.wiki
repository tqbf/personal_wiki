Some great thoughts tonight after smoking:

The names of the week days come from the names of the gods. If the gods represent
primeval behavior patterns and archetypes, then each weekday can have a separate 
function. A weekday for sex (lining up with the mon is perfect for this) a day
for learning, a day for cleaning, etc. and the priest conducts all of this.

We could designate a day to each 

This is where we must ask ourselves, do we unite to accomplish a single goal, 
or do we attempt to pursue multiple goals at once.

Realistically, I think that many of our goals could all be accomplished simultaneously 
if we accomplish one large goal. 

So, who is present here?

There is health, the eyes in particular as a goal.
There is wealth, investments and debt-freeness of family as a goal.
There is dna, the goal of children.

sailthru is my tribe now
if I must, I will lead it
one day.

The four hour work day. That's what I'm going for.





Sailthru can still be my tribe, but I'll make my mark by running a startup while at sailthru.

I can compete with Tumblr by being way classier and awesome than it. But basically be Github for bloggers.

What language should I write it in?
