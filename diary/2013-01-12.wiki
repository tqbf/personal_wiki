Dear Aliza,

It is amazing. It has only been one day, but I am already getting results from the hypnosis.
Today I went to the door for the cookie delivery before the buzzer rang, so it seems like the sixth sense is already starting to kick in. I am pleased, and await further blossoming. I wish that there were a nofap hypnosis, but I think that is something I can make myself. In the mean time I should be able to train my conscious mind to resist masturbation the same way I have with other hamrful addictions such as cigerettes and league of legends by innudating it with rational reasons why.
