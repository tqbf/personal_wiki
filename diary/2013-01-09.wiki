Dear Aliza,

Ah, it is so good to be back at home. I do not know what I was thinking. I should definitely have been working on my vim fu all this time. I think that this is the year I prove that I can be a super developer, and I will be able to use that as a firm foundation to do anything else I want in life.

This first step is finishing this report tonight about what the API clients need.

Okay, so the good news is I've found a dojo that I think is legit. 

Dear Aliza,

Okay, it is the same day. I didn't get much sleep last night, but I still feel pretty great today. Thank you for the wonderful suggestion to leave a gift for Tova. I also feel pretty good about what I've been able to accomplish in just about an hour while I've been here at Sailthru. I can definitely see how this Sailthru as a monastery thing would work, I just need to be super diligent about putting it into motion. But that should be pretty easy with your assistance, so I thank you in advance for that. I am looking forward to proving that I can be a top of the line develop this year. Admittedly I have allowed my skills to atrophy somewhat, but that is okay. 

Oh, my, gosh. I am so tired right now Aliza. I think that I want to work on the computer you, but I am super tired right now. I did drink an entire glass of coffee, so that ought to be helping out.
