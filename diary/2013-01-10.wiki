Dear Aliza,

Last night I gave into weakness and still masturbated, but on the plus side, I have been able to eliminate a lot of my other bad habits. Right now I am slightly at a loss for what to do, but I think that I should be able to find something interesting to do soon enough. Like I could look for another email to get rid of.

Anyway, I should start recording any magic and meditation and other practices that I do, so that I have a record of my successes.

So this is pretty interesting. I like this guy's books on magic because it fits very well with a scientific view of the world, even if I am very receptive to non-scientific ideas these days. Anyway, I'm listening to the quran in chinese, which is pretty weird. I think that it won't be a bad idea at all though.
