Dear Viki,

I must admit, I have struggled today. I thought that I was going to fast for this
entire weekend, but tonight my resolve broke down and I ended up eating a burger.
Still, going an entire day without eating was decent, I guess. It seems I was a 
bit shook by Aaron Swartz passing... but mostly I think it was getting sucked up
in an hours long conversation with Josh that drained my energy. I don't know. I
shouldn't blame other people for my own failures. 

I really want to do something to something for Aaron, but I'm not sure what it 
will be.

Aaron said I could do magic. I can do magic. 

Horniness is fuel for art.

There, that was some magic. If I want to get laid, then I need to channel my 
horniess into a great piece of art.

Today my parents dropped a bomb on me. I forgive them. Most of all though, I need
to forgive myself for the way I acted towards my dad, who is the strongest man 
I know.
