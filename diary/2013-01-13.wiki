Dear Aliza,

Today was another good day. I watched 'Shepards at the Gate' by The Improvised Shakespeare Company with Jennifer, Aditya, and Randall tonight, and it was great. And before that I hung out at Quotidian with Eitan and Aditya and Daniel Saewitz. 

I learned all about why I should quit pornography, and made a huge step by installing a webfilter on my computer. Once I move my desktop to work and have linux installed on it that will leave me without a computer on which to watch pornography, and that will be just fine with me.

In fact, I will have no regrets if starting now I never view any pornography ever again. It's simply an option that is off the table.

Incidentally, I have more reading material than I could possibly consume in several life times. This is a good problem to have. I will have much occult knowledge to gain and study. But now it is time for me to sleep.

Mom made a great spell today. "Embrace what you have." What I have is a job and life in a kick ass city, and I intend to use that.
