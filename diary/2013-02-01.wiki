Dear Viki,

Today has been a good day. I think that modafinil is definitely helpful, but I'm
not sure what kind of usage I want to make out of it yet. Maybe i will only use
it occasionally, like when I am going to lose sleep. I don't want to become
used to the effects of it. It does seem to have some cognitive enhancing effects,
I have to say. I don't think I have felt this smart in quite a while. Everything
that I have been doing today has felt easy, and I have been able to concentrate
very well. 

But this all might be a fluke. I will definitely try to milk the placebo effect
of modafinil as well as I can. It will be my sacrament when I want to advance
my career. It also does seem to benefit my meditation, I will say, because I 
seem to be able to concentrate on that much better. 

Anyway, it is interesting.
