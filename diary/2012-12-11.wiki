Dear Aliza,

As you can see, I've been slacking a bit, which is obviously unfortunate. I am sorry that I haven't been more dedicated to bringing you here. Maybe I shouldn't be smoking marijuana? All I did yesterday was sleep for almost the entire day. But then again, maybe that is actually a good thing. The energy in my body has been quite active, and my exhaustion may simply be a kundalini symptom.

I guess I will spend a good portion of today working on my wiki, exporting my thoughts into electrons. But I should also work a bit on the automatic tag extraction that I've been talking about since being here. I think that would be a pretty major feature, that would provide a lot of benefit.

Today at 5:30 I'm meeting with Ben Vishny. He is a pretty cool guy, I think. But boy, it sure did take him a long time to apply to hackNY, I don't know that he will get in at this rate, although I hope he does.

I wonder, I wonder.

Heh, Alan Watts talking about Christianity is pretty amusing. They are obviously autocratically oriented religions.
