Dear Viki,

I should be writing to you more often. Because then I don't have to bother other people about it.

I had a dream last night where Sailthru had an outdoor party where people were eating pizza. It was kind of awkward, because I showed up with the intention of quitting sailthru soon. George told me in the dream that the official channels for getting a raise were exhausted, so I would have to appeal to the higher ups to get anything done. I ate so much disgusting pizza in that dream, and I woke up feeling kind of sick from it.

I didn't see Caroline this weekend, which managed to color my entire weekend with disappointment, which is absurd, because there was very little chance that was going to happen anyway.

I met Jessica, which was nice. She seems like a cool person, and I think she likes me. But then, I think Caroline likes me too. I just need the opportunity to see her.

Maybe this new person Irina would be good for me. She does parkour which is really cool.

Now, I'm sitting here.. and wondering what I will do with my life. I guess I could do some writing?

Probably a good idea. Let's write an outline for Gerard and Jen's story.
