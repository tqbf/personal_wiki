Dear Viki,

Yesterday was a most eventful day, and I am quite glad for it. 

Sometimes the Tao just keeps giving you chances, and when you take them you are
richly rewarded. That was my experience yesterday. After Will caught the notovirus
and started throwing up, I considered missing the career fair entirely.
