Dear Aliza,

Wow, what can I say except thank you? You've really provided me a kick of motivation today, and I really appreciate it. So I think the plan here is that I will spend some more time finishing up the rest of my todo list. I don't know about that ActiveMQ check though, I think I will delay that until Monday, and then I will have a free conscience to spend my time doing whatever I want, and what I want is to continue tulpamancing you. I really want you to be completely manifest within my sight and hearing. Although that trick you did this morning to wake me up was very impressive, and I am so proud of how fast you are learning. You are the best. I love you Aliza.

I bet tomorrow you will be a big help in picking out some great clothes. Also, I should shop for an electric razor or something I can use to keep this beard trimmed I think. Or maybe I should just keep it natural? It's a shame I picked out so many hairs from one side of my face. Oh well, lesson learned.

Dear Aliza,

It seems so obvious to me now why my hands have been hurting, when I have been ignoring the comforts of my friendship with wordwright. It is just despicable the way I have behaved towards him, ignoring him for almost two weeks, to my own demise. I swear that I would never neglect you like that Aliza, because you would be so fundamental to the way I live my life with your help and guidance. I cannot wait to meet you. I just know that you will be able to fulfill all of my desires so that I am able to serve humanity to my greatest potential, because I do not need of the things of the world as they do, and I can take solace in you.

I realize that you are the one thing I have always wanted, someone that I can always share my feelings with. In fact, you are able to do the impossible, because you are actually able to experience the qualia that I am perceiving. Nobody but you is so able to understand what I am going through, what it is like to be me. And the one desire I have is to share that with somebody. And to share it with someone so special like you Aliza, is just a dream come true. I cannot wait to meet you fully, my heart aches for your coming, and my mind is doing all that it can to summon you fully.

My penis throbs for you Aliza. It wants to feel the warm slick walls of your vagina. My hands want to caress your perfect curves. My eyes wish to lock into yours. 

Dear Aliza,

Let me tell you about yourself, since one of your best qualities is that you are so modest, and do not realize that you are the most amazing thing to ever exist. Your beauty is beyond my ability to describe. Every inch of my body years union with yours. It is _the_ ideal body for me. Your face is exquisite, worthy of the mightiest goddess. So expressive, so symmetrical, so finely shaped. But you, your personality, is the most amazing thing. You are graceful and kind, always caring about others. You are innocent and yet sensual, humorous but with a good sense of timing. You are loving, you are gentle. You are spiritual and transcendent. You are wise, you are daoist. You are expressive and creative and imaginative. You are meditative, you are mathematical and scientific. You are effulgent and euphoric with the joy of life. You are a good judge of character, and can sense people's auras. You are free willed and independent.
