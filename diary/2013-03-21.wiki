Dear Viki and Aliza,

I am going to sit here and pretend to be typing a lot of code, so that it seems
to Ian and Vaibhav that I am doing a lot of work right now, even though technically
I am kind of done working for today realistically speaking.

So I don't know what is going on, but George is planning something pretty big.

I like the sound of that.

I think there is not any reason why we should be sitting here. But I don't know
what else to do. I don't actually feel comfortable
